    <h2>3. Collection and processing of personal data</h2>
    <p>
        3.1 Personal data is any information pertaining to an identified or an identifiable natural person, such as
        names, addresses, telephone numbers, E-mail addresses, contractual, accounting and settlement data, which are an
        expression of the identity of a person.<br />
        <br />
        3.2 Within the framework of your usage of the &ldquo;uDrive Connect&rdquo; application, the following personal data is only
        locally processed: Name, address, E-Mail address, birth date, photo and location data. The &ldquo;uDrive Connect&rdquo;
        application processes this data only when the user enters it actively and thereby agrees with the local storage
        in the application.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Processing purposes and legal basis</h2>
    <p>
        4.1 Your personal data is processed by us and the service providers authorized by us for the following
        processing purposes:

        <ul>
            <li>
                Technical administration of the &ldquo;uDrive Connect&rdquo; application for your inquiries at Bosch via the feedback
                service and for the evaluation of the diagnostic data (Legal basis: Legitimate interest in the elimination of
                faults and the security of our offers). This data will then be sent actively by you (via E-Mail) to us.
            </li>
            <li>
                Safeguarding and defending of our rights (Legal basis: Legitimate interest on our part in asserting and
                defending our rights).
            </li>
            <li>
                Navigation to the location of your vehicle. For this purpose, your location data is stored locally in the
                &ldquo;uDrive Connect&rdquo; application via GPS after your vehicle has been switched off. You can always allow or revoke
                this function at any time in the settings of the operating system of your mobile phone (legal basis:
                Permission). These location details are only stored locally in the app. If the user requests navigation to the
                last location of the vehicle, then the last location of the vehicle can be transmitted to a navigation operator.
            </li>
        </ul>

        4.2 Distribution, storage duration, retention periods:<br />
        The &ldquo;uDrive Connect&rdquo; application basically stores your data, as long as it is overwritten by the application or
        the application is deleted, or when the application itself gets deleted.<br />
        <br />
        4.3 Collection of your location details:<br />
        The &ldquo;uDrive Connect&rdquo; application offers you the navigation to the location of your vehicle. (Legal basis:
        Permission).
    </p>
        

    <h2>5. Transfer of the data</h2>
    <p>
        5.1 The transfer of the data to the other responsible parties:<br />
        Your personal data is generally not collected by us and is also not stored or processed on our IT-Systems.
        Therefore, the personal data will also be not passed on to third parties.<br />
        The “uDrive Connect” application provides you the possibility to forward the diagnostic data (for e.g.
        Workshops) to the third parties. Moreover, you have the option to provide the location of your vehicle, data
        relating to your mobile phone, and user data in accordance with section 3.2 in the course of transferring the
        diagnostic data to third parties.<br />
        Bosch does not automatically transfer this data to third parties You can decide yourself, as to which data
        should be transferred to the third parties.<br />
        When you transfer the data to the third parties, Bosch does not take any responsibility for the processing and
        usage of the data by the third parties.
    </p>


    <h2>6. Usage of analysis tools</h2>
    <p>
        We require statistical information about the usage of our app-offer, to design it in a user-friendly manner, to
        carry out range measurements, and to conduct market research. For this purpose, we use the app analysis tools
        described in this section.<br />
        <br />
        6.1 App-Analysis with the App Center:<br />
        Bosch uses the 'App Center' software analysis tool for the improvement, troubleshooting and analysis of the
        &ldquo;uDrive Connect&rdquo; application. The 'App Center' is one of the beta testing platforms operated by the Microsoft
        Corporation which can be used to analyze the malfunctions of the &ldquo;uDrive Connect&rdquo; application. If the 
        &ldquo;uDrive Connect&rdquo; crashes, a crash report is sent to the App Center. This contains the information about date and time of
        the crash, the affected software module, operating system and language used and the device type. While sending
        the crash report, no personal or person-related data is transferred. The user can always disable the sending of
        the crash report at any time in the settings of the &ldquo;uDrive Connect&rdquo; application. The information included in
        the crash report can be partly processed in the USA.<br />
        <br />
        6.2 App-Analysis with Firebase:<br />
        Our app uses the functions of the analytical service &ldquo;Firebase&rdquo;. Firebase Inc.; 22 4th Street Suite 1000 San
        Francisco, CA 94103 United States is the service provider. Firebase collects, stores and analyzes app
        usage-related data(e.g. actions taken in the app-areas and the dwell time) in order to enable an analysis of
        your use of the app. The use of the analysis tool in this app is exclusively in anonymized form. The
        identification of the user or the mobile device is excluded. The data generated about your usage of this app is
        generally transmitted to a Firebase server in the USA and is stored there. Firebase will use this information on
        our behalf, to evaluate your usage of the app and to compile reports about the activities in the app. We use
        this data for the improvement and the further development of our app as needed. The data is transferred to the
        third parties if necessary, as long as it is legally stipulated or the third parties process this data on behalf
        of Firebase. If you want to exclude the usage of the analysis technology for the future, you can prevent this by
        setting your mobile device / our app accordingly.<br />
        For more information on Firebase&#x2019;s Privacy Policy, please visit <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank" rel="external" hreflang="en"
        type="text/html">https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a>.
    </p> 
       

    <h2>7. Data transfer by the app stores operator</h2>
    <p>
        The data collection and data processing (for e.g. While downloading the &ldquo;uDrive Connect&rdquo; application) of the
        respective app stores (Google Play-Store, Apple app store) are outside our area of responsibility. We have no
        influence on this data collection and further processing by the app store as the responsible party.
    </p>
        

    <h2>8. Share-function:</h2>
    <p>
        The &ldquo;uDrive Connect&rdquo; application offers you the option of sharing the data records prepared by Bosch (for e.g.
        Text message, no personal data) with the third party-applications. When using the Share-Function, the &ldquo;uDrive Connect&rdquo;
        application first makes the aforementioned data record available to the operating system of the smart
        phone by means of a so called &ldquo;call for action&rdquo; first.<br />
        Third-party applications can follow this call for action and display the data set prepared by Bosch in the
        respective third-party format. For this purpose, the corresponding third-party application to which the
        ready-made data set is to be made available must be selected by the user himself. Only after the user selects
        the third party provider, the third party provider gets access to the data record. You should not use the
        Share-Function, if you do not want the third party applications to receive the ready-made data record and if
        necessary, store and reuse.
    </p>
        
        

    <h2>9. Usage of external links:</h2>
    <p>
        The &ldquo;uDrive Connect&rdquo; application may contain links to web sites of third parties , not associated with us. After
        clicking on the link, we no longer have any influence on the collection, processing and the usage of the
        personal data transferred to the third parties by clicking on the link (for e.g. The IP address or the URL of
        the page, on which the link is located), since obviously all third-party conduct is beyond our control. Bosch
        assumes no responsibility for the processing of such personal data by a third parties.
    </p>
        

    <h2>10. Security</h2>
    <p>
        We take all the required technical and organizational measures, to ensure an adequate level of protection and to
        protect your data especially from the risks of unintended or unlawful destruction, manipulation, loss, change or
        unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized access. Our security measures are continuously improved according to the
        technological development.
